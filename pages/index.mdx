# Firebase Cheat Sheet

I found myself too often frustrated while looking up Firebase JavaScript SDK documentation and not finding what I want quickly, so I decided to create this little cheat sheet. Feel free to contribute on [GitHub](https://github.com/KristjanRetter/Firebase-cheatsheet). I will add new stuff here soon, like storage, auth, setup, and cloud functions. Feel free to [follow me on 𝕏](https://x.com/KristjanRetter); I will share updates on the project there.
